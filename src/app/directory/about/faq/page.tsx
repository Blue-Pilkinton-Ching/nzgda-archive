        <H2>• What content is available on HEIHEI?</H2>
        <P>
          The content on HEIHEI is a combination of shows, games, audio and
          competitions. A lot of the content has been commissioned especially
          for HEIHEI and made by New Zealand creators. Alongside our locally
          made work is a curated selection of high quality international
          content.
        </P>

        <H2>• What age children is HEIHEI designed for?</H2>
        <P>
          HEIHEI is aimed mostly at children aged 5-9, but we’ve made sure that
          there’s content for kids of ages 4+ to love. And parents and
          caregivers too!
        </P>

        <H2>• What safety features are in the app?</H2>
        <P>
          All the content on HEIHEI is child-friendly and has been checked and
          curated by real people here in NZ. The app is free, with no in-app
          purchases or adverts. There are a limited number of links out to
          external sites and these sites are reputable child-friendly sites
          which are monitored regularly
        </P>

        <H2>• Are my details safe?</H2>
        <P>

          securely. For more information check out our privacy and safety page.
        </P>

        <H2>• What costs are associated with the app?</H2>
        <P>
          This is a free service provided by NZ On Air and TVNZ. There are no
          in-app purchases or hidden fees in HEIHEI. However, if you use mobile
          network connections (3G or 4G) your operator may charge you for the
          amount of mobile data you use. If you are unsure how much mobile data
          costs on your tariff, contact your network operator.
        </P>

        <H2>• What devices and operating systems is HEIHEI available on?</H2>

        <H2>• Why does this game take so long to load?</H2>
        <P>
          Depending on your internet connection, games can take several minutes
          to load. Be patient - they’re worth the wait!
        </P>

        <H2>• I wish to lodge a complaint about HEIHEI content</H2>

        <H2>• I’m not in New Zealand - can I still watch HEIHEI content?</H2>
        <P>
          Due to current content restrictions, the HEIHEI site and app content
          can only be viewed in New Zealand at this stage. However, for a taste
          of what we’re about, you can watch some content on our NZHEIHEI
          YouTube page or follow us on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and
          Snapchat.
        </P>

        <H2>
          • I am not familiar with the Te Reo Māori words on the HEIHEI
          app/site. Help?
        </H2>
        <P>
          Kia ora/ Hello! We are proud to incorporate Te Reo Māori (one of the
          three official languages of Aotearoa/New Zealand) into HEIHEI. Here
          are some kupu/words you might come across on HEIHEI: Mātaki - Watch
          Tākaro - Play Whakarongo - Listen Whiwhinga - prizes Tamariki -
          children Heihei - chicken, noise, disturbance, commotion If you’d like
          to learn more about words found in the individual shows - we recommend
          searching www.maoridictionary.co.nz
        </P>

        <H2>• Great, there are no ads - so how is HEIHEI funded?</H2>
        <P>
          HEIHEI is primarily funded by NZ on Air as part of their commitment to
          supplying New Zealand tamariki with quality, local and international
          content in an online space that feels distinctly kiwi, safe and fun.
          TVNZ are also investing in the project as part of the company’s
          commitment to being NZ’s local storyteller.
        </P>
